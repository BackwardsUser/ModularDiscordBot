# ModularDiscordBot
A Discord bot that focuses on modularity and "mod like" functionality. If you need it to do something on the fly you can dynamically load or unload, Commands, Events, Configurations, or even Clients.
Discord Bots suck for non-technical individuals, you're locked between choosing a pre-made bot which usually lock custom functionalities behind paywalls or don't provide enough functionalities, another alternative are bot maker tools, which again lock you to the edge cases that the developers of the app allow for, a lot of advanced functionalities aren't possible. The last choice is getting a bot custom made for your server, which can cost a lot of money depending on what the developer requests.

Modular Discord Bot turns bot development into something more akin to Minecraft Modding, this allows you the freedom of code, while keeping it in a small footprint allowing it to be less daunting for newer coders.

While this tool still faces many challenges as other methods, it would allow for much more freedom and allow for more customizability.
